        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Simply the best baked ziti recipe. I am half Italian, was raised eating the finest Italian-American cuisine, and have filmed almost 2,000 recipe videos, so when you consider all of those facts, it seems incredible that I have never posted a video for baked ziti.</p>

        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ pound hot Italian sausage</li>
            <li>¾ pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
            <li>2 (24 ounce) jars prepared marinara sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta</li>
            <li>1 drizzle olive oil</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain sausage on paper towels and reserve 2 tablespoons grease in the skillet. Add oil to grease in the skillet; cook and stir onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes in the hot oil-grease until onion is soft, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir chicken broth, pumpkin, bacon, Italian seasoning, and salt into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir cream and sausage into broth mixture and simmer until creamy and thickened, about 5 minutes. Add rotini and gently toss. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish and top with Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and golden brown, about 35 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
